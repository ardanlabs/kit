Package cfg provides configuration options that are loaded from the environment.
Configuration is then stored in memory and can be retrieved by its proper
type.

To initialize the configuration system from your environment, call Init:


	cfg.Init("myapp")

To retrieve values from configuration:


	porc, err := cfg.String("proc_id")
	port, err := cfg.Int("port")
	ms, err := cfg.Time("stamp")

Use the Must set of function to retrieve a single value but these calls
will panic if the key does not exist:


	porc := cfg.MustString("proc_id")
	port := cfg.MustInt("port")
	ms := cfg.MustTime("stamp")






## func Init
``` go
func Init(namespace string) error
```
Init is to be called only once, to load up the giving namespace if found,
in the environment variables. All keys will be made lowercase.


## func Int
``` go
func Int(key string) (int, error)
```
Int returns the value of the giving key as an int, else it will return
an error, if the key was not found or the value can't be convered to an int.


## func MustInt
``` go
func MustInt(key string) int
```
MustInt returns the value of the giving key as an int, else it will panic
if the key was not found or the value can't be convered to an int.


## func MustString
``` go
func MustString(key string) string
```
MustString returns the value of the giving key as a string, else it will panic
if the key was not found.


## func MustTime
``` go
func MustTime(key string) time.Time
```
MustTime returns the value of the giving key as a Time, else it will panic
if the key was not found or the value can't be convered to a Time.


## func String
``` go
func String(key string) (string, error)
```
String returns the value of the giving key as a string, else it will return
an error if key was not found.


## func Time
``` go
func Time(key string) (time.Time, error)
```
Time returns the value of the giving key as a Time, else it will return an
error, if the key was not found or the value can't be convered to a Time.
