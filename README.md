# Kit [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ardanlabs/kit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ardanlabs/kit)

A set of common packages for building applications in Go.

This code has been developed for use in Hardcore Go training classes and client projects. We will be working hard to maintain backwards compatibility with each package's API. A proper set of documentation is required and we will be working on this as well.

You should be vendoring the packages you choose to use. We recommend using [govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor). This tool will vendor from the vendor folder associated with this project repo for the dependencies in use. It is recommended to use a project based repo with a single vendor folder for all your dependencies.

If you have any questions about vendoring or the use of these packages, please send me an email.
